HOW TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN GET ON THE SERVER
So every mod is gonna be here EXECPT for Twilight Forest which is too big to put in the folder here. That mod you will have to download your self.
Curseforge.com is gonna be the best bet; the file is called {twilightforest-1.12.2-3.11.1021-universal} and that will be all the mods.
Take all the mods, go to bottom left of the desktop screen, search "%appdata%" and find ".minecraft", if you have the forge installed and have already opened it.
There should be a folder called, "mods" where u can paste all the mods in. Once they are all in there close it, open minecraft, and try to join the server.
Good luck lmk if you need any help with anything :) Have fun!
